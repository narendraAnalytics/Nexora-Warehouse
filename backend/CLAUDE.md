## Project Context

**Domain:** Wholesale electronics distribution across 5 Indian branches
**Branches:** Hyderabad · Bangalore · Chennai · Mumbai · Pune
**Products:** TVs, Mobiles & Tablets, Gaming Consoles, Networking Equipment, Accessories & Peripherals

**Key Business Problems Solved:**
- Stockouts & overstocking across multiple warehouses
- Manual procurement replaced by AI-driven PO automation
- Supplier unreliability — proactive risk detection & scoring
- Logistics chaos — intelligent dispatch & route optimization
- Manual CEO reporting — autonomous daily AI briefings at 8:00 AM
- Poor decision-making — data-driven recommendations with audit trails

**Target Business Outcomes:** 30–35% reduction in stockouts · 25% faster procurement cycle ·
Automated CEO briefings · Full profitability & inventory visibility · Improved cash flow

---

## Current Build Status

**Phase: 0 — Fresh Scaffold**

- Python 3.12.10 pinned via `.python-version`
- All core dependencies installed via `uv`
- `main.py` is a placeholder — no business logic written yet
- No subdirectories exist yet (agents/, api/, database/, etc.)
- No `.env` file — environment variables not yet configured

**Next step:** Phase 1 → FastAPI app skeleton + Neon database setup

---

## Package Manager

This project uses **`uv`** exclusively. Never use `pip` or `poetry`.

```bash
uv add <package>           # install a new dependency
uv run <command>           # run any command inside the venv
uv sync                    # sync venv from pyproject.toml + uv.lock
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload   # start dev server
uv run pytest              # run tests
uv run alembic upgrade head        # run DB migrations (when configured)
```

## Agent Architecture

### Orchestration Layer

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| **CEO / Executive Agent** | Top-level decision maker. Receives KPIs, risks, revenue, inventory status. Produces executive recommendations and the daily 8:00 AM briefing. |
| **Orchestrator Agent** | Heart of the system. Routes tasks to domain agents, resolves conflicts, manages multi-step workflows, handles human-in-the-loop approval gates. |

### Domain Agents (11)

| # | Agent | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Inventory Intelligence Agent** | Stock monitoring, reorder detection, overstock detection, warehouse balancing |
| 2 | **Demand Forecast Agent** | Demand prediction, seasonal analysis, sales trend modeling |
| 3 | **Procurement Agent** | PO creation, supplier selection, cost optimization |
| 4 | **Supplier Risk Agent** | Delay prediction, supplier scoring, alternative supplier recommendations |
| 5 | **Warehouse Transfer Agent** | Multi-warehouse balancing, transfer recommendations |
| 6 | **Logistics & Dispatch Agent** | Dispatch planning, vehicle allocation, route optimization |
| 7 | **Order Fulfillment Agent** | Order tracking, delay detection, escalation management |
| 8 | **Risk Intelligence Agent** | Global risk aggregation, business impact prediction |
| 9 | **Finance & Profitability Agent** | Revenue analysis, cash flow analysis, margin tracking |
| 10 | **Communication Agent** | Email alerts, WhatsApp notifications, manager escalations |
| 11 | **Knowledge & RAG Agent** | SOP retrieval, document search, policy lookup, historical decisions |

### Human-in-the-Loop Gates

Manager approval required (via LangGraph interrupt) for:
- High-value purchase orders
- Cross-warehouse stock transfers
- Supplier replacement decisions
- Emergency escalations

---

## Database Schema (12 Tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Clerk-authenticated users with roles |
| `warehouses` | 5 branch warehouses (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune) |
| `products` | Electronics catalog with categories |
| `inventory` | Stock levels per product per warehouse |
| `orders` | Customer orders and fulfillment status |
| `suppliers` | Supplier profiles, scores, contact info |
| `purchase_orders` | AI-generated and approved POs |
| `stock_transfers` | Cross-warehouse transfer records |
| `deliveries` | Logistics and dispatch records |
| `finance_records` | Revenue, costs, cash flow entries |
| `agent_logs` | Full audit trail of all agent decisions |
| `executive_decisions` | CEO agent recommendations and outcomes |

---

## Memory Architecture

### Short-Term Memory — Redis (1–7 days)
- Active agent sessions and workflow state
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Pending human approval requests
- Running LangGraph checkpoints

### Long-Term Memory — PostgreSQL + pgvector (years)
- Historical agent decisions and outcomes
- Sales history and demand patterns
- Supplier performance history
- Risk events and resolutions
- Executive decision archive (for RAG)

---

## RAG Knowledge Base

Four knowledge layers stored in pgvector:

| Layer | Content |
|---|---|
| **Business Knowledge** | SOPs, operational policies, internal workflows |
| **Supplier Knowledge** | Contracts, SLAs, pricing agreements |
| **Logistics Knowledge** | Shipping rules, delivery zones, routes |
| **Executive Knowledge** | Historical decisions, strategy documents, KPI benchmarks |

**RAG Pipeline:** PDF Upload → Chunking → Embeddings (Gemini) → pgvector → Retriever → Groq LLM → Answer

---

## Inngest Event System

| Event | Trigger | Agents Activated |
|---|---|---|
| `inventory.low` | Stock falls below reorder threshold | Inventory Agent → Procurement Agent |
| `order.created` | New customer order placed | Order Fulfillment Agent |
| `supplier.delay` | Supplier reports or predicts delay | Supplier Risk Agent → Procurement Agent |
| `warehouse.transfer` | Transfer approved or needed | Warehouse Transfer Agent → Logistics Agent |
| `finance.updated` | Revenue/cost data updated | Finance Agent → CEO Agent |
| **Cron: 08:00 AM daily** | Scheduled morning briefing | CEO Agent (full system analysis) |

---

## CEO Morning Briefing (Daily 8:00 AM)

Auto-generated executive summary containing:
- Revenue yesterday vs. target
- Pending collections and receivables
- High-risk orders (delivery/supplier risk)
- Stockout risk items (top 5)
- Supplier delay alerts
- Cash flow status
- Top 3 recommended actions with priority

Delivered via: Email (Resend) + Dashboard notification + (later) WhatsApp

---

## Role-Based Access (Clerk)

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| **CEO** | Full access — all dashboards, CEO briefing, executive decisions |
| **Operations** | Warehouse, inventory, transfer, logistics dashboards |
| **Finance** | Finance dashboard, procurement costs, revenue reports |
| **Suppliers** | Limited supplier portal — own POs and delivery status only |

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` in the backend root (never commit it):

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@neon-host/nexora

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# LLM APIs
GROQ_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=

# Auth

## Build Order (24 Steps)

Follow this sequence strictly — later steps depend on earlier ones:

```
1.  Environment Setup          → Python 3.12, uv, Docker, Redis, Postgres client
2.  FastAPI Backend            → main.py, app structure, health endpoint
3.  Neon Database              → connection, SQLAlchemy async engine, 12 tables
4.  Redis Memory               → short-term memory manager
5.  RAG System                 → pgvector, chunking, embedding pipeline
6.  Inventory Agent            → LangGraph node, tools, state
7.  Demand Forecast Agent      → time series, seasonal analysis tools
8.  Procurement Agent          → PO creation, supplier selection logic
9.  Supplier Risk Agent        → scoring, delay prediction
10. Warehouse Transfer Agent   → multi-warehouse balancing

20. Clerk Auth                 → JWT validation middleware, role guards
21. Next.js Frontend           → (separate directory, starts Phase 13)
22. WebSocket Real-Time        → live inventory, order status, agent decisions
23. WhatsApp Integration       → Meta API, supplier/manager notifications
24. Monitoring & Deployment    → Loguru, Prometheus, Sentry, Railway/Vercel
```

## Development Notes

- **LangGraph over raw LangChain:** All multi-step agent logic must use LangGraph `StateGraph`. Never chain agents with simple LangChain `RunnableSequence` for anything stateful.
- **Async everywhere:** FastAPI routes, database calls (asyncpg), and Redis calls must all be `async def`. Celery handles truly CPU-bound or long-running work.
- **Pydantic for all I/O:** Every API input/output and agent state must be a Pydantic v2 model. No raw dicts crossing module boundaries.
- **MCP in Phase 2+:** Do not add MCP (Model Context Protocol) until all core agents are working. Add PostgreSQL MCP first, then File System, Google Sheets, Email MCPs.
- **Package manager is `uv`:** Never suggest or use `pip install`. Always `uv add`.
- **No frontend work until Phase 13:** Backend APIs must be stable and tested before touching Next.js.
